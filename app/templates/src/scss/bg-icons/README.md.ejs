# The Background icon folder

Put your SVG background-images you're referencing in your SCSS-files in here.

All SVG-files will be processed with svgmin.
After that the icons will be inlined as data-URIs in the form of SASS-placeholders.
These icons can be referenced in a SCSS file by using the svg-background mixin.
